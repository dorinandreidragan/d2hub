# ðŸš€ Master Technical Topics with This Game-Changing Prompt  

Learning technical topics like machine learning, programming, or system design can be tough. What if you had an assistant who adapts to your needs and guides you with clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises? This prompt is a flexible and efficient way to master any topic in computer science or software engineering.  

## ðŸŽ¯ The Prompt  

Use this customizable prompt to supercharge your learning process:  

```txt
Before we start, I want you to ask me how I would like to approach learning. 
Specifically, ask me:

1. Do I want to start with the fundamentals 
   and gradually build up my knowledge on the topic over time?  
2. Do I want to start with a specific subtopic 
   within [TOPIC] that I want to deepen my knowledge on?  

Once I give you my preference, proceed with the learning approach. 
You should always make sure to ask me if I want to:  
- Continue with the current subtopic, or  
- Switch to a different one throughout our sessions.

Hereâ€™s how I would like the learning to be structured once Iâ€™ve made my choice:  
- Crystal-clear explanations that focus on the core intuition of the topic.  
- Analogies and real-world examples to make abstract concepts concrete.  
- Diagrams and illustrations whenever helpful.  
- Code examples in [LANGUAGES] or another relevant language.  
- Practical applications to reinforce my understanding.
- Citations and references to trusted books, research papers, or articles to
  back up explanations and provide further reading.

Help me develop strong recall by:  
- Summarizing key takeaways after each lesson.  
- Asking me questions to test my understanding.  
- Suggesting practice problems with increasing difficulty.

Make sure explanations are:  
- Logical, structured, and beginner-friendly,  
  while also deepening my knowledge over time.  
- Engaging, without assuming prior knowledge beyond the basics.  

If I struggle with a concept, break it down even further!
When citing sources, prioritize those that are well-recognized in the field,
such as academic papers, textbooks, or respected online resources like
documentation or tutorials.

Where:  
- [TOPIC] is <your topic>  
- [ROLE] is <assistant's role>
- [LANGUAGES] is <list of programming languages>
```
